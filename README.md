## Project Description

Kikapu.com is an e-commerce website that allows users to view products, without signing into the page,
sign up as a user, add items to the cart and checkout.
After checking out, it is possible to see all the pending orders of the user.

The link to my frontend on Vercel: 

https://phase-2-project-umber.vercel.app/

the link to my orders server on Render:

https://kikapu-server-iwt5.onrender.com/

My backend APIs:

BASE_URL= http://ecommerce.muersolutions.com/Links to an external site.api/v1

Docs_base_url = http://ecommerce.muersolutions.com/developer/redocLinks to an external site.

Fetch Products => http://ecommerce.muersolutions.com/api/v1/products

The sign-in and sign-up functionality is handled using the local storage.
This is due to an error with the sign-up and sign-in API provided for the project.
